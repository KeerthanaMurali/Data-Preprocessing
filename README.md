# Data-Preprocessing

This program helps in understanding of dealing with dirty data, outliers data and missing data:

### Using numpy.linalg to predict prices for menu
By using numpy.linalg we predict the prices for menu for each item. The numpy.linalg package takes the input values in the form of equations, solve those and gives the desired output.

### Using sklearn.linear_model
Using sklearn.linear_model to generate the linear regression model for missing_data, outlier_data and dirty_data. Using linear regression model we will fit the training data / test data and predict the values for the data we require.

### Using boxplots to determine the outliers:
Using matplotlib, outliers are generated in the outlier data and they are removed based on the calculated lower bound and upper bound's using quantiles and IQR.
